# Tutor Me

Tutor Me is a Django application that a team of 4 students and I developed during a semester-long project. The application allows individuals to create a profile, register as a tutor or student, and search classes at UVA to be a tutor for/receive tutoring for. Students are able to view a list of available tutors to request for the classes they desire, and tutors are able to approve or deny requests. The application also has additional features which can be viewed here: [https://a25.herokuapp.com/](https://a25.herokuapp.com/). In addition to being a developer on the team, I served as the Scrum Master.
