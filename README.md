# Tutor Me

Tutor Me is a Django application that a team of 4 students and I developed during a semester-long project. The application allows individuals to create a profile, register as a tutor or student, and search classes at UVA to be a tutor for/receive tutoring for. Students are able to see a list of available tutors to request for particular classes and tutors are able to approve or deny requests. In addition to being a developer on the team, I served as the Scrum Master.
